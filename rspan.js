  /*
NOTE: Due to the particular nature of the complex span (interleaving
sentence and letter within and across trials), the 'main_sentences'
timline variable is not treated as a traditional timeline variable.
Rather, the array is randomized and then for each sentence an index
selects one element (sequentially). Because the array was randomized,
this ensures that the main sentences are presented in random order
AND that each sentence is only presented one time in the experiment.
There is probably a more elegant way of doing this, but oh well.
